# IPTO - A data management framework

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/FrodeRanders/ipto)

A data management system which automates handling of dynamically defined data sets. Specifically, the
definition of data sets can be done using GraphQL SDL. 

As such, this system operates on two levels: GraphQL and Java. Configuration of data sets is done using
GraphQL SDL. Data can be stored and retrieved via GraphQL, but it is also possible to use the Java API
directly.
